# Distributed Java RMI application for Remote Exam Management 
I realized this Software Engineerign project during my staying at Universit√† della Calabria. It was rated 6/6 points. This repository includes the both the assignment and my solution. It is an IntelliJ project built with Gradle. It can be setup adjusting the paths in the ad hoc scripts for client and server bootstrap.
